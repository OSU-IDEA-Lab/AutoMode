Following is the more generalized steps to run Automode for any dataset such as Immortals, UWCSE, IMDB, HIV, CORA,
WebKB.
 
Steps to run on UWCSE dataset:

1. Automode Setup:
1.1 Setup the dataset in Voltdb
    - Run examples/uwcse/load.sh to setup the data in voltdb
    
1.2 Run: examples/uwcse/run.sh to run the Automode 
    - This script does two things:
    1. It runs the profiling algorithm to generate the inclusion dependency(DB tables and target query tables included)
    2. It runs AutoMode setup client to generate the modes. The script uses inds generated in step-1 
    
    - sh run.sh approximate 0.5 automode-input/setup_inds.txt out/dataModel_advisedby.json abs 5 advisedby UWCSEProcedure 
          
            Script Parameters:
            -algorithm              :   exact/approximate
            -maxIndError            :   This is to specify exact or approximation inclusion dependency 0 for exact
            -inputIndFilePath       :   Path to save intermediate ind file generated by Profiling algorithm
            -outModeFilePath        :   Path to save output Mode file generated by AutoMode
            -constThresholdType     :   Specify threshold type (abs or pctg)
            -constThresholdValue    :   Threshold value
            -target                 :   target query(advisedby)
            -storedProcedure        :   stored procedure name to be used by Castor   
     
     Mode is generated and stored under "out" directory and other intermediate results such as setup_inds.txt are stored under automode-input directory           


Steps to run on Immortals dataset:

Automode Setup:
 Setup the dataset in Voltdb
    - Run examples/immortals/load.sh to setup the data in voltdb

*** One step method ****   

Run: examples/immortals/run.sh to run the Automode 
    - run.sh script will generate modes for all queries from query1 - query9. This script does two things:
    1. It calls the setup.sh script to generate the base modes 
    2. It calls the run_script.sh to generate the query specific modes 

    sh run.sh approximate 0 automode-input/setup_inds.txt automode-input/setup_modes.json pctg 18 automode-input/schema-immortals.json automode-input/manual-constants
    
            Script Parameters:
            -algorithm              :   exact/approximate
            -maxIndError            :   This is to specify exact or approximation inclusion dependency 0 for exact
            -inputIndFilePath       :   Path to save intermediate ind file generated by Profiling algorithm            
            -inputModeFilePath      :   Path to save intermediate Mode file generated by AutoMode
            -constThresholdType     :   Specify threshold type (abs or pctg)
            -constThresholdValue    :   Threshold value
            -schema                 :   Specify schema.json file, this helps in differentiating db tables and query tables
            -manualTunedConstants   :   Path to manual constants language file 
     
     Mode is generated and stored under "out" directory and other intermediate results such as setup_inds.txt are stored under automode-input directory           
    

*** Two step method ***

1. Run: examples/immortals/setup.sh to generate the base modes
    -The script does two things:
    1. It runs the profiling algorithm to generate the inclusion dependency(target query tables will be omitted)
    2. It runs AutoMode setup client to generate the base modes. The script uses inds generated in previous step 
     
    sh setup.sh approximate 0 automode-input/setup_inds.txt automode-input/setup_modes.json pctg 18 automode-input/manual-constants automode-input/schema-immortals.json
    
            Script Parameters:
            -algorithm              :   exact/approximate
            -maxIndError            :   This is to specify exact or approximation inclusion dependency 0 for exact
            -inputIndFilePath       :   Path to save intermediate ind file generated by Profiling algorithm            
            -outModeFilePath        :   Path to save intermediate Mode file generated by AutoMode
            -constThresholdType     :   Specify threshold type (abs or pctg)
            -constThresholdValue    :   Threshold value
            -manualTunedConstants   :   Path to manual constants language file 
            -schema                 :   Specify schema.json file, this helps in differentiating db tables and query tables
     
     The intermediate Mode and inds are generated and stored under given path in this case automode-input             
    
2. Run: examples/immortals/run_query.sh to generate the final modes
    -The script does two things:
    1. It runs the profiling algorithm to generate the one way inclusion dependency. 
       This step will extract the inclusion dependency between target query table and rest of database schema -
       
    2. The one way inds and setup modes generated in step-1 will now be used to generate the final modes to learn target query.
       It runs AutoMode per query client to generate the final modes for given target query
    
    sh run_query.sh query1 automode-input/schema-immortals.json automode-input/query1_inds.txt automode-input/setup_modes.json out/dataModel_query1.json 0 CastorProcedure_query1
    
            Script Parameters:
            -target                 :   Query to be learned by castor
            -schema                 :   Specify schema.json file, this helps in differentiating db tables and query tables
            -inputIndFile           :   Path to save intermediate ind file generated by Profiling algorithm            
            -inputModeFile          :   Path to save intermediate Mode file generated by AutoMode
            -outputModeFile         :   Path to save final Mode file generally stored in out directory
            -maxIndError            :   This is to specify exact or approximation inclusion dependency 0 for exact
            -storedProcedure        :   stored procedure name to be used by Castor            
    
     This step will generate the final mode for given target which is now ready to be used by castor
